# Time-Series-Forecasting-with-New-York-Taxi

## Introduction
This project mainly focuses on the principle and application of time series theory. I used New York taxi data to implement on. 

## Code and Data
You can find them in the same repo as this readme file.

## Summary
- Developed a Python workflow for collecting, cleaning, storing, and analyzing over 10GB of New York cab trip records
from 2010 to 2024, and created Tableau dashboards to visualize the data and support decision-making at higher levels.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis, including component decomposition, rate of change, sliding averages, and downsam-
pling; performed ADF stability testing and differential smoothing.
- Generated autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots, fine-tuned and compared multiple time series models, reduc-
ing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) by approximately 12%.
- Proposed and validated a hypothesis testing model for cab passenger flow using external data and Poisson regression,
establishing a significant correlation between passenger flow and commercial activities.
